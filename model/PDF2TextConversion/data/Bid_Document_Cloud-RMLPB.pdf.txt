ABOUT ORGANIZATION 
 

Description of water resources like wells, canals and dams could be seen at many places 

in Vedas. In Rig-Veda description of wells, kavat could easily be seen at many places. 

Water from well, used to be fetched from wheels made of stone, in which container is 

tied to rope. Wells were not only used to fetch the water for daily use of humans and 

animals, but were also used for irrigation too. In Rig-Veda word ‘Awta’ is also 

mentioned which is the symbol of Well. In other hymn word ‘Kulya’ is being 

mentioned, which means ‘Artificial Canal.’ In Yajurveda one can see the description of 

‘digging of canals.’ Even Guru of Devas ‘Brahaspati’ had said that repairing and 

modification of dams and canals is a holy practice and rich society of state should take 

its responsibility. Whole this history clears that irrigation sources have always been an 

important part of civilization and livelihood. 

Around 3150 B.C. many epics described the irrigation farming since the time of 

Mahabharat. When Rishiraj Narad visited King Yudhisthir’s state to meet him in this 

context, then he questioned him about the condition of farmers in his state, that whether 

they are healthy or not? Are reservoirs large and sufficient and do they have sufficient of 

water and does water is supplied to various parts of state? All these questions and 

concerns shows that even in Mahabharat Era irrigation was one of the main agenda for 

development of the society. 

About: Irrigation Department Uttar pradesh 

Since the formation of Irrigation and Water Resource Department U.P., it is focused 

toward the development and construction of dams, canals and wells. Department 

executed it objective and facilitated the state’s citizens’ with the sufficient facility of 

irrigation and in meanwhile department also executed flood prevention works and 

always strives to avoid horrors of flooding.

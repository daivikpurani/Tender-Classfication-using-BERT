23(a). A demand draft of Rs. 500/- (Rupees Five Hundred Only) towards non-refundable 

tender fee and a demand draft of Rs. 11,900/- (Rupees Eleven Thousand Nine Hundred 

Only) towards refundable EMD from a nationalized bank/schedule bank in favor of “IIT 

Gandhinagar Project and Consultancy Account” payable at Gandhinagar placed in a 

separate envelope marked “Tender Fee & EMD” should accompany tender bid documents.

should be valid for 90 days (Demand Drafts must be complied with CTS 2010 standards 

prescribed by Reserve Bank of India). Without the tender fee and EMD the bid will not be 

considered.  
 

(b). Valid NSIC and MSE Certificates will be accepted for relaxation of EMD and tender 

fee. Presently EMD/Tender Fee exemptions and price preference are applicable to only Micro 

and Small Industries. In view of the above, if the vendor will claim for EMD/Tender Fee

vendor must have to submit the supporting documents like NSIC registration certificate, MSE 

registration certificate issued by competent government bodies to become eligible for the tender 

fee/EMD exemptions. The certificates of the vendor (NSIC/MSE) shall cover the items 

tendered to get EMD/Tender Fee exemptions. NSIC certificate shall be valid as on due 

date/extended due date of the tender. This is not applicable for non NSIC unit. 
 

 

Note – In case the bid is submitted as an Indian arm of a foreign bidder and the eligibility 

criteria conditions were met through foreign company, then the EMD exemption cannot be 

claimed under the MSME status of India arm/subsidiary. Thus a bidder who solely on its 

own, fulfills each eligibility criteria condition as per the tender terms and conditions and who 

are having MSE status, can claim EMD exemption/tender fee. 
 

 

(c). The EMD of the successful bidder will be returned without any interest after completion 

of the successful installation. The earnest money of unsuccessful bidders will be returned to 

them without any interest within thirty (30) working days after awarding the offer. For 

further query regarding the EMD, vendor/bidder(s) are required to contact with Deputy 

Registrar (A&MM) through e-mail, purchase@iitgn.ac.in.

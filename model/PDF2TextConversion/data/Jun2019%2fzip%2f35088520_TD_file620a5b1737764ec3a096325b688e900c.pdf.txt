Annexure -II 

Preamble: The following benchmarks have to be conducted and submitted along with the technical 

bids (See point 2 of Technical Instructions). The benchmarking must be done on the proposed 

hardware, software and network architecture only. The OS must be Ubuntu OS 18.XX 64 bit only. 

  

HPL:  This is the widely used implementation of the Linpack TPP benchmark. It measures the 

sustained floating point rate of execution for solving a linear system of equations in double precision 

(64 bits) arithmetic on distributed-memory computers. The HPL software package  requires 

the availability on your system of an implementation of the Message Passing Interface with an 

implementation of either the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms. Only the latest version of 

opensource Netlib HPL benchmarking must be used. 

Run on all CPUs of the rack server (i.e. CPU-CPU) considering Approx N = 235930 (problem 

size); the problem size should be chosen to the maximum extent in order to gain the maximum 

output of the system. HPL performance with Rpeak/Rmax < 70% will lead to immediate 

disqualification.

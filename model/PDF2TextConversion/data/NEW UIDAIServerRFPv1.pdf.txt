2.1.1 Reverse Auction



T-11014/09/2017-Tech

Page 21 of 139

1. After opening of the commercial bids, reverse auction process (RAP) will be

done for the bidders who are eligible to participate in the e-auction as per the

scheduled date and time to be intimated later.

2. After opening of the commercial bids, the lowest NPV quoted by the bidders will

become the auction start price for auction and the participant bidders have to

quote below the auction price in the auction.

3. The Bidder shall bid lower than the opening price in multiples of the decrement

value, but a Bidder must always bid lower than the Lowest Bid.

4. The auction will be done on NPV (to be entered by bidder) which will be derived

based upon Capex (of 3 year warranty) and Opex (of 4 year AMC) as mentioned

in para 24 below. It is exclusive of any taxes

5. Only one bidder shall be at a particular position / rank, which means only one

L1.

6. The minimum decrement value will be Rs 1,00,000/- (Rs One Lakh only) from

the start bid price. The reduction shall have to be made as per decrement value

or in multiple thereof.

7. The Bidder will be able to view the following on his screen along with the

necessary fields: i) Opening Price. ii) Leading Bid in the Auction, i.e., the lowest

bid. iii) Bid placed by him. At no point of time will any bidder see the names of

other bidders, or the prices of bidders other than the lowest bid.

8. A bidder can continue to revise his bid till the auction ends. However, the

Bidder cannot quote/Bid equal to the Leading / Lowest Bid. He must always

quote lower than the Leading/Lowest Bid.

9. The evaluation criteria is based on Price alone in auction. The Bidder who

quotes the lowest evaluated Price (NPV) is determined as the lowest bidder.

10. System protects bid and bidder information till auction gets over and displays

current L1 price to the bidder.

11. Initial period of reverse auction will be two hours in the slot of 1o minutes. There

will be auto extensions of time every time by ten minutes in case of any

reduction recorded in the last ten minutes. The reverse auction will come to a

close only when there is no further reduction recorded in the last ten minutes

slot.

12. The log details of the entire reverse auction process will be generated by the

system once the process of reverse auction is completed.



T-11014/09/2017-Tech

Page 22 of 139

13. If a bidder does not submit his bid in the Reverse Auction, the price quoted by

him in the price bid shall be considered as the valid price of that bidder. The

status of the bidder (L1, L2 etc) shall be evaluated considering either the bid

price submitted in Reverse auction or the Price quoted in the price bid,

whichever is lower.

14. Since, reverse auction is a sequel to e-tender, the process of finalizing the tender

upon completion of reverse auction will be same as the tender process without

reverse auction.

15. The bid history shall reflect only the NPV exclusive of taxes. The NPV will not

be same for two bidders even if any bidder makes such an attempt.

16. Only the chronologically last price bid submitted by the bidder till the end of the

auction shall be considered as the valid price bid of that bidder. Any bid

submitted earlier by the bidder prior to submission of his last bid will not be

considered as the valid price bid.

17. Server time shall be the basis of Start time & Closing time for bidding and shall

be binding for all. This would be visible to all concerned.

18. All electronic bids submitted during the reverse auction process shall be legally

binding on the bidder. The chronologically last bid submitted by the bidder till

the end of the auction will be considered as the valid price bid offered by that

bidder and acceptance of the same by UIDAI will form a binding contract

between UIDAI and the bidder for entering into a contract.

19. Conditional discounts shall not be considered. If a bidder offers a discount

unilaterally after submission of bid, the discount shall not be considered for

evaluation of offers but shall be availed if order is placed on such tenderer.

20. If the lowest price received during reverse auction is unreasonable or it is

unacceptable on ground of being too high compared with estimated price, the

UIDAI management reserves right to seek justification of the price from lowest

bidder. If the price is not considered reasonable, management may not accept

such bid and go for another tender process.

21. In case of disruption of service at the service provider's end while the RAP

is online, due to any technical snag or otherwise attributable to the system

failure at the server end, the RAP process will start all over again. In such a

situation, the last recorded lowest price of prematurely ended RAP, will be the

'Start Bid' price for the restarted RAP. The prices quoted in the prematurely



T-11014/09/2017-Tech

Page 23 of 139

ended RAP will be binding on all the bidders for consideration, if the restarted

RAP does not trigger within the stipulated time.

22. However, if Reverse Auction does not lead to any bid, UIDAI shall reserve the

right to award the job based on the lowest prices quoted in online commercial

bid.

23. The successful bidder needs to submit the revised BoQ in line with lowest NPV

quoted by him in reverse auction. The ratio of percentage decrease in cost of

each component (both Capex and Opex) shall be same as the overall percentage

reduction in the NPV originally quoted by bidder and final L1 NPV quoted by

bidder. It is as explained below

Example

There are 3 bidders having following NPV from their commercial bid

S No. Bidder Name NPV in Rs. Lakh

(Exclusive of Taxes)

1 A1 1000.00 ( i.e. Rs 10 Cr)

2 A2 1160.90 (i.e. Rs 11.6 Cr)

3 A3 1200.00 (i.e. Rs 12.0 Cr)

The auction start price will be price quoted by bidder A1 i.e Rs 10 Cr.

The bidder during reverse auction will decrement the price in the multiples of

Rs 1 Lakh. After successful reverse auction, the NPV quoted by bidders are as

below

S No. Bidder Name Final NPV in Rs. Lakh

(Exclusive of Taxes)

1 A1 900

2 A2 1000

3 A3 800

Thus Bidder A3 is winner of reverse auction. Bidder now needs to submit the

revised BoQ in line with successful NPV quoted by him in the reverse auction.

Original price quoted by bidder A3 in its commercial bid is as below



T-11014/09/2017-Tech

Page 24 of 139

Quoted Capex Cost

(Without Tax) Rs Lakh

Quoted AMC Cost for 4

Years (Opex) (Without

Tax) Rs Lakh

Equipment 1 370 250

Equipment 2 400.8 302

Total 770.8 552

NPV = 770.8+ (552)/((1+.0875)^3) = Rs 1200 Lakh

Thus reduction in NPV by Bidder A3 is (1200-800)/1200*100 i.e 33.33%. The

same percentage deduction will be done on every component mentioned in the

BoQ for deriving final price for each component.

Final Capex Cost

(Without Tax) Rs Lakh

Final AMC Cost for 4

Years (Opex) (Without

Tax) Rs Lakh

Equipment 1
370*(1-.3333)

=246.68

250*(1-.3333)

=166.68

Equipment 2
400.8*(1-.3333)

=267.21

302*(1-.3333)

=201.34

Total 513.89 368.02

NPV = 513.89+ (368.02)/((1+.0875)^3) = Rs 800 Lakh

Thus, final BoQ and the contractual value that will be submitted by bidder A3 is

:

Duration
Final Capex Cost

(Without Tax) Rs Lakh

Final AMC Cost for 4

Years (Opex) (Without

Tax) Rs Lakh

Equipment 1 246.68 166.68

Equipment 2 267.21 201.34

Total 513.89 368.02

Contractual Value =Rs 881.91 Lakh



T-11014/09/2017-Tech

Page 25 of 139

24. The detailed Break-up of offered cost, provided by the bidder shall be

considered and order, if placed, shall be with the same break-up of prices. The

bidder(s) after reverse auction will be responsible to ensure that the rate as per

the breakup of prices provided by him after the reverse auction and total value

offered by him in the reverse auction are in same proportion. The bidder will

not be allowed to increase the rate of any equipment while submitting the

breakup. While giving the break up, the bidder will have to consider same rate

of taxes and duties as quoted while submitting the commercial bid. In case the

bidder(s) fail(s) to submit the final BoQ within 3 days or the break up given by

bidder does not match with total offered price, the UIDAI will be at liberty to

place order by proportionately reducing the equipment rates on basis of the

breakup of the e-price bid submitted by the bidder along with the initial offer

and the same will be binding on the bidder.

Page 57 of 139

Thus yearly AMC charges will be calculated from Total AMC changes as below:

Y= Y4 + Y5 + Y6+ Y7

Y= x + (x*1.1) + (x*1.12)+ (x* 1.13 )

i.e Y= x*4.641

Where

Y= Total Cost at Sl.No.2 of Annexure 4.2.3

Y4=x= Fourth year AMC Charges = Y/4.641

Y5 = Fifth year AMC Charges = x*1.1 = Y*1.1/4.641

Y6 = Sixth year AMC Charges = x*1.12 = Y*1.21/4.641

Y7 = Seventh year AMC Charges = x*1.13 = Y*1.331/4.641

Example :

If Rs 4,641 is quotes as total AMC charges for total 4 years, then the yearly AMC

charges will be considered as below

AMC cost for 4th year = x = 4641/4.641 = Rs 1,000/-

AMC cost for 5th year = x*1.1 = 4641*1.1/4.641 = Rs 1,100/-

AMC cost for 6th year = x*1.12 = 4641*1.21/4.641 = Rs 1,210/-

AMC cost for 7th year = x*1.13 = 4641*1.331/4.641 = Rs 1,331/-

The quarterly payment will be (Yearly charges of that year)/4

(Yearly AMC cost/quarterly AMC cost of each equipment/good/hardware shall also

be calculated as given above)

3.12 Currency of Payment

Payment shall be made in Indian Rupees only.

WHEREAS, we the undersigned Bidder,

__________________________________, having our principal place of

business/ registered office at _________________, are desirous of bidding for Bid

No.……… covering “Supply, Installation, Commissioning and Post warranty

maintenance of Servers” (hereinafter called the said 'RFP') to the CEO, Unique

Identification Authority of India, having its office at 3rd Floor, Tower II, Jeevan Bharati

Building, Connaught Circus, New Delhi – 110001, hereinafter referred to as ‘Purchaser'

and, WHEREAS, the Bidder is aware and confirms that the Purchaser’s business/

operations, information, Application/software, hardware, business data, architecture

schematics, designs, storage media and other information / documents made available by

the Purchaser in the RFP documents during the bidding process and thereafter, or

otherwise (confidential information for short) is privileged and strictly confidential

and/or proprietary to the Purchaser,

NOW THEREFORE,

in consideration of disclosure of confidential information, and in order to ensure the

Purchaser’s grant to the Bidder of specific access to Purchaser’s confidential information,

property, information systems, network, databases and other data, the Bidder agrees to

all of the following conditions.

It is hereby agreed as under:

1. The confidential information to be disclosed by the Purchaser under this Declaration

(“Confidential Information”) shall include without limitation, any and all information in

written, representational, electronic, verbal or other form relating directly or indirectly to



T-11014/09/2017-Tech

Page 123 of 139

processes, methodologies, algorithms, risk matrices, thresholds, parameters, reports,

deliverables, work products, specifications, architecture, project information, money

laundering typologies, related computer programs, systems, trend analysis, risk plans,

strategies and information communicated or obtained through meetings, documents,

correspondence or inspection of tangible items, facilities or inspection at any site to which

access is permitted by the Purchaser. We also hereby agree that this NDA will be binding

on us through-out the contract period and will survive the contract period in case we are

selected as a successful bidder.

2. Confidential Information does not include information which:

a. the Bidder knew or had in its possession, prior to disclosure, without limitation on its

confidentiality;

b. information in the public domain as a matter of law;

c. is obtained by the Bidder from a third party without any obligation of confidentiality;

d. the Bidder is required to disclose by order of a competent court or regulatory authority;

e. is released from confidentiality with the written consent of the Purchaser.

The Bidder shall have the burden of proving hereinabove are applicable to the information

in the possession of the Bidder.

3. The Bidder agrees to hold in trust any Confidential Information received by the Bidder,

as part of the Tendering process or otherwise, and the Bidder shall maintain strict

confidentiality in respect of such Confidential Information, and in no event a degree of

confidentiality less than the Bidder uses to protect its own confidential and proprietary

information. The Bidder also agrees:

a. to maintain and use the Confidential Information only for the purposes of

bidding for this RFP and thereafter only as expressly permitted herein;

b. to only make copies as specifically authorized by the prior written consent

of the Purchaser and with the same confidential or proprietary notices as

may be printed or displayed on the original;



T-11014/09/2017-Tech

Page 124 of 139

c. to restrict access and disclosure of Confidential Information to their

employees, agents, and representatives strictly on a "need to know" basis,

to maintain confidentiality of the Confidential Information disclosed to

them in accordance with this clause; and

d. to treat Confidential Information as confidential unless and until Purchaser

expressly notifies the Bidder of release of its obligations in relation to the

said Confidential Information.

4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Bidder acknowledges that the nature of activities to

be performed as part of the Tendering process or thereafter may require the Bidder’s

personnel to be present on premises of the Purchaser or may require the Bidder’s

personnel to have access to software, hardware, computer networks, databases,

documents and storage media of the Purchaser while on or off premises of the Purchaser.

It is understood that it would be impractical for the Purchaser to monitor all information

made available to the Bidder’s personnel under such circumstances and to provide notice

to the Bidder of the confidentiality of all such information.

Therefore, the Bidder shall disclose or allow access to the Confidential Information only

to those personnel of the Bidder who need to know it for the proper performance of their

duties in relation to this project, and then only to the extent reasonably necessary. The

Bidder will take appropriate steps to ensure that all personnel to whom access to the

Confidential Information is given are aware of the Bidder’s confidentiality obligation.

Further, the Bidder shall procure that all personnel of the Bidder are bound by

confidentiality obligation in relation to all proprietary and Confidential Information

received by them which is no less onerous than the confidentiality obligation under this

agreement.

5. The Bidder shall establish and maintain appropriate security measures to provide for

the safe custody of the Confidential Information and to prevent unauthorised access to

it.

6. The Bidder agrees that upon termination/expiry of this Agreement or at any time

during its currency, at the request of the Purchaser, the Bidder shall promptly deliver to

the Purchaser the Confidential Information and copies thereof in its possession or under

its direct or indirect control, and shall destroy all memoranda, notes and other writings

prepared by the Bidder or its Affiliates or directors, officers, employees or advisors based

on the Confidential Information and promptly certify such destruction.

7. Confidential Information shall at all times remain the sole and exclusive property of the

Purchaser. Upon completion of the Tendering process and/or termination of the contract

or at any time during its currency, at the request of the Purchaser, the Bidder shall

promptly deliver to the Purchaser the Confidential Information and copies thereof in its

possession or under its direct or indirect control, and shall destroy all memoranda, notes

and other writings prepared by the Bidder or its Affiliates or directors, officers, employees

or advisors based on the Confidential Information within a period of sixty days from the

date of receipt of notice, or destroyed, if incapable of return. The destruction shall be

witnessed and so recorded, in writing, by an authorized representative of the Purchaser.

Without prejudice to the above the Bidder shall promptly certify to the Purchaser, due

and complete destruction and return. Nothing contained herein shall in any manner

impair rights of the Purchaser in respect of the Confidential Information.

8. In the event that the Bidder hereto becomes legally compelled to disclose any

Confidential Information, the Bidder shall give sufficient notice and render best effort

assistance to the Purchaser to enable the Purchaser to prevent or minimize to the extent

possible, such disclosure. Bidder shall not disclose to a third party any Confidential

Information or the contents of this RFP without the prior written consent of the

Purchaser. The obligations of this Clause shall be satisfied by handling Confidential

Information with the same degree of care, which the Bidder applies to its own similar

Confidential Information but in no event less than reasonable care.

SECTION II: INSTRUCTIONS TO BIDDERS 

 

INTRODUCTION 

 

The State of Gujarat was formed in the process of the reorganization of the States, 

with effect from 1st May, 1960.  Although Gujarat had no organized State Archives 

Department, till ten years of reorganization of Bombay State. But it had been 

associated with the Indian Historical Records Commission through Universities.  So 

the former Balvantrai Mehta Ministry of Gujarat realized the necessity of Archives 

department and took decision in June 1964 to set up a separate State Archives in 

Gujarat.  The concept of State Archives was, however, concretized in December, 

1971 when a separate Department of Archives was set up. 

 

After survey, appraisal and classification of old records, State Archives come to 

conclusion that Gujarat is fortunately very rich in terms of Archival wealth which may 

be classified as under: 

 

(1) The records of the former Princely States lying within territory of Gujarat State.  

(2) The records of British period lying in the District offices within the Gujarat State.  

(3) Private Records in possession of institutions and individuals such as religious 

trust, wakf properties, former Girasdar, Inamdars, Taluqudar, Administrator and 

Scholars.  

 

In order to spread the Archival Activities and Record Management in the State, two 

circle offices with a record repository at Vadodara and Rajkot have been constituted.  

Five District Offices with Records center at Jamnagar, Bhavnagar, Porbandar, 

Junagadh, Mahesana and one Archival Functional Building with scientifically 

constructed Archival Repository being as a Head and Administrative office at 

Gandhinagar have been constituted.   

 

In order to spread the Archival Activities and Record Management in the State, the 

state Archives has divided the whole Gujarat into two circle offices for better Archival 

Administration.  Each circle & District offices have been given the charge of certain

districts and talukas for implementation of Archival Policy Resolution.   Gradually, the 

State Archives has started, separate Five district Record centers named as District 

Archives offices for effective administration. 

  

HOLDING OF RECORDS AND THEIR FINDING AIDS OF STATE ARCHIVES 

   

Archives Dept. have been carved out from several Princely States and Political 

agencies of British India.  The former rulers and administrators connected with the 

former Princely administration and agencies of British India are in possession of very 

old and valuable records of archival importance in form of files, Registers, 

manuscripts, etc.  These records constitute a part of historical and cultural heritage 

of Gujarat and are very useful for research and reference.  

 

The records holdings of the Archives Dept. are broadly divided into two distinct 

series, viz., the records of the former princely states and the secretariat records. The 

records of princely states comprises of manuscripts / Books, volumes and 

proceedings etc. from 1820 to 1947 A.D. These records also contain information 

regarding administrative set up of these states and their relations with British 

Government.  After the integration of States these records came under the custody 

of the Revenue Department.  After 1971 the State Archives has took over the charge 

of selected record offices for better preservation and conservation of records.  The 

Secretariat Records comprised of proceedings and files for the period of 1947 to 

1960. 

Under the provision of Gujarat Historical Research Rules 1976, all records which are 

30 years old are open for consultation for bonafide researchers.  Foreign Scholars 

are required to produce letter of introduction from their respective embassies / High 

Commissions and also from the Universities / Institutions.  And the permission 

should also be taken from the Government of India & State of Gujarat.  All 

applications for permission to consult the records are to be addressed to the Director 

of Archives and concerned Head of the Offices of respective Record Offices.

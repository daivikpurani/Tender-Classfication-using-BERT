Clinical Application in
General for Orthopedic
operating table

Orthopedic tables are
specialized operating
tables that provide an
elevated surface for
supporting the
patient's body and
include specific
apparatus for
supporting and/or
providing traction for
the patient's limbs
during orthopedic
procedures. These
tables stabilize the
patient's position and
provide the operating
surgeon with optimal
exposure of the
surgical field.
Applications for these
tables include both
upper-extremity
procedures (e.g.,
shoulder surgery,
nonoperative
myelograms, spinal
surgery) and lower-
extremity/hip
procedures (e.g., hip
pinning, Ender nailing,
intramedullary nailing
of the femur, tibia, and
fibula). Some
orthopedic tables can
also accommodate C-
arm radiographic/fluoro
scopic studies

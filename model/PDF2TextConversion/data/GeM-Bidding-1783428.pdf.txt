Classification [24-248]"

Clinical Purpose Hematology Analyzers
are used to count and
characterize blood cells
for disease detection
and monitoring. Basic
analyzers return a
complete blood
count(CBC) with a
5-part differential white
blood cell(WBC)
count.Sophisticated
analyzers measure cell
morphology and can
detect small cell
populations to
diagnose rare blood
conditions.

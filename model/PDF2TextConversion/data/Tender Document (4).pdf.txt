Annexure 6 

Formula for award of contract 

 

The financial evaluation would be done strictly on following terms and 
conditions: 
 

1. All the bidders may apply for one or more zones, as mentioned in the RFP; 
however the contract will be awarded for only one zone to the L1 bidder. 
 

2. The decision to award contract to a particular eligible bidder will be in a 
priority sequence, as defined in the RFP, where the contract for the top 
priority Zone will be decided first and then rest will follow in sequence. 
 

3. All the eligible bidders, who have quoted for a Zone will be arranged in 
increasing order of their financial bids and the contract will be awarded to the 
L1 Bidder. Incase the L1 Bidder fails to comply/ fulfill the necessary terms and 
conditions for the award of contract; the same will be awarded to next lowest 
bidder where the L2 bidder will have to match the rates of L1 bidder and fulfill 
all the necessary terms and conditions for award of contract. The same 
process will be followed for all the Zones as specified in the RFP. 
 

4.  Incase of a conflict situation, following will be done: 
 

a. Incase the same bidder is L1 in more than one Zone, the contract will 
be awarded to bidder for the Zone with higher priority and for the rest of 
Zones, he will not be considered except for the fact that the 2nd lowest 
bidder in that Zone does not agree to match the rates of the first L1 
bidder for award of Contract. 
 

b. All the bidders who have not been L1 in earlier priority Zones will be 
listed independently in the subsequent Zones in order of priority in 
increasing order of financial bids. Unless there is conflict, the same 
process of awarding the contract to L1 bidder will be followed. Incase 
of conflict, the process as defined in point 3 and 4(a) will be followed. 

 
Exception: 
 
Exception will be followed only in cases where no bidder is ready to match L1 rate 
and / or there are not enough bidders available for the Zone, the work will be 
awarded to original L1 bidder, even if he has been awarded the contract for any 
higher priority Zones earlier during the process. 
 
Note: GIL/SC&DLR reserves the complete right to take final decision to award 
contract based on the process described above.

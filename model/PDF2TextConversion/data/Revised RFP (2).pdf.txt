respective Regional GM/EDs. 

 

c)   It shall be the responsibility of Bidder to transport the equipment to site for the Installation & Commissioning. Charges 

for the same should be included in SOR Item no. A 1 to A 38. Materials not installed / not to be installed need to be 

shipped to location as decided by RGM/Executive Director of the Region. SOR items against which Installation is not 

separately mentioned, installation shall be considered within the scope of supply itself. 

 

d)  The Schedule of Requirement has been divided into three parts, viz. Schedule –‘A’ including item nos. A1 to A 38 and 

Schedule – ‘B’ including item nos. B 1 to B 21 and Schedule – ‘C’ including item no. C1. 

 

e)    The bidder must ensure that the capacity of storage system supplied at the Station should be supplied with an additional 

50% capacity over and above the capacity required for 7 days recording computed on the basis of cameras given for respec-

tive station from day one. The storage capacity should be calculated considering RAID6 configuration. The additional ca-

pacity is required to meet the compliance requirement of keeping the flagged/marked images/video footage as a evidence 

required by the RPF/GRP/Appropriate authority for investigation purpose and also to cater the requirements of provision of 

any new cameras on the station.  Bidder is advised to quote the unit rate against each category of stations considering the 

above total capacity requirements. 

In case more storage capacity in addition to the above mentioned is required in the storage system then the cost towards 

the additional capacity in terms of Tera Byte (TB) would be calculated on pro-rata basis on the lowest per TB cost 

among the offered storage systems against the A1/A/B category of stations. 
 

II 

In item no. C 1 of Schedule –‘C’, if however the bidder feels that his AMC Cost is less than 3.5% per annum, he should give 

suitable discount in equipment/supply item pricing. For AMC he will be paid @ 3.5% per annum only.  If the vendor quotes 

a higher base rate for AMC he will be paid at his quoted rate per annum and five year differential cost shall be added to 

equipment cost for evaluation.  

III 

For item no. B.16 (a) and B.16 (b) , if the bidder feels that the Manpower support can be given at rates lower than the rates 

as defined, then he should adjust the differential amount in the equipment/supply pricing, and he will be paid according to 

the defined rates only. However, if the bidder quotes a higher base rate than the rates as defined then he will be paid at his 

quoted rate and the differential shall be taken for evaluation. 

The bidder is supposed to quote for the manpower requirement of 2-years period of warranty period post Maintenance Su-

pervision period, as during this period the contractor shall be responsible for proper maintenance supervision of the system 

free of cost for a period of twelve months from the date of provisional acceptance (for more details please refer to section 

4.A.2.5) 

* Quantities mentioned are the bare minimum requirement of the purchaser, however if bidder feels that larger manpower 

strength is required to maintain the installed network, then bidder is free to revisit the quantities mentioned. The bidder 

would also be required to deploy the same number of manpower resources during the 12 months period of maintenance 

supervision as quoted for the item no. B. 16 (a) and B.16 (b) of SOR for the commercial bid. 

IV 

Since, RailTel is also implementing Wi-Fi work at railway stations, therefore, the existing available infrastructure may be 

utilized by the purchaser for implementation of VSS system and such items used may not be considered as a part of Supply 

orders.  

V 

Bidder should submit the soft copy (Word/Excel/PDFs format) of offer in DVDs/USB’s. Bill of Material (BOM) must be in 

PDF as well as Excel format (except price bid). Bidder is allowed to quote only for a single Make/Model of the quoted items

design documents duly vetted by respective OEM(s) as same would be required for the technical evaluation of the offer. 

 

Bidder would be responsible for ensuring the complete system is operational and meeting the requirements as mentioned in 

the RFP. However if at any stage before the issuance of FAC for the system installed, it is found that the system perfor-

mance is not compliant with the functional requirements and specifications given in the RFP document, the bidder shall be 

liable/obliged to supply additional hardware/systems at no additional cost to the purchaser, required to meet the functional 

requirements and specifications mentioned in the RFP document at no additional cost to the purchaser. Purchaser’s engineer 

decision in this context will be final.

3.A.1.3  Project Background 

Indian Railways endeavors to set up high-tech surveillance systems at selected 

railway stations for providing safe, secure and pleasant experience to railway pas-

sengers especially women & children. Indian railways is the lifeline of India and 

has an estimated daily ridership of approximately 2 crores. Approximately 25% 

of the total stations in India would be covered under surveillance in this project. 

This is therefore likely to benefit the daily as well as occasional commuters tre-

mendously. 

The Government’s commitment towards this vision is reflected in the meeting 

held in PMO on Sept’2015 in which it was proposed to provide video surveil-

lance system at 983 stations of A1, A, B and C category under ‘Nirbhaya  Fund’. 

Out of these 552, 279 stations are of A1 and A category spread out in 67 divi-

sions of 16 zones. The project envisages to provide high level security vigilance 

and improve the ensuing action in case of an alert by adding state of art functions 

like motion detection, quick review and intrusion detection. This would ultimate-

ly lead to a manifold increase in the security of the passengers as compared to 

present situation. 

 

The stations chosen for this RFP include some of the most prestigious stations of 

Indian Railways including A-1 stations and stations having RPF Chowkis on 

which 24X7 surveillance will help the daily commuters tremendously by reduc-

ing the incidents of pick pocketing, theft, damage to public property etc. 

 

Indian Railways has appointed RailTel to invite interested & capable parties for 

providing round the clock IP based video surveillance across the stations and se-

lect the most competitive proposal for implementation.

3.B.1 Architecture Overview 

 

To implement video surveillance solution, each station should have robust, secure and scala-

ble network architecture implemented which will cover all platforms and other areas such as 

waiting halls, ticket counters, entry, exit, refreshment area, and foot over bridge, parking area 

etc. of a railway station. 

 

In addition to robust, secure and scalable network architecture on railway stations, fully se-

cure network architecture will be required on Cloud. This network will work as a platform for 

implementation of Video Management, Video Recording, Video Analytics and Facial 

Recognition System etc. on cloud as well. 

  

As this is a highly visible project for Indian Government, Ministry of Railways and RailTel, 

related to safety and security of women under “Nirbhaya Fund”. Therefore, the proposed ar-

chitecture must be secure end to end so that misuse of recorded video or video clips can be 

prevented. 

 

3.B.2 Power and Fiber Distribution Design for Railway Stations 

 

A 6 sq.mm 3 core power cable will terminated to UPS System at each platform from ACDB. 

4 sq.mm 3 core power cables will be drawn from this UPS systems to each access switch lo-

cation. 

 

A 24 core fiber cable will start from 24 port FDMS/LIU towards each platform and will ter-

minate to another 24 port FDMS/LIU on same location after completing a physical ring of 

cable. First 2 cores of this 24 core fiber cable will be terminated at aggregation switch loca-

tion at platform 1, another 2 core at aggregation switch location at platform 2/3 and so on. 

 

 A 12 core fiber cable will start from this termination point of 2 cores of 24 core cable at ag-

gregation location and connect each access switch location on that platform in ring topology 

physically and star topology logically. 4 core of this 12 core fiber will be terminated on each 

access switch (Type-I Switch) location. All access switches on same platform will form a star 

topology with aggregation switch at each platform. Further, IP Cameras will connect on 

CAT-6 STP cables to these access switches to provide video service.  

 

If there is a requirement to connect more access switches for platform extension, any other 

locations or any other services aggregation switch will have sufficient ports available. Also 

there will be sufficient fiber core available to make this connectivity possible from scalability 

point of view. 

 

 Typical diagram for fiber core distribution for one platform is shown below. Same topology 

will be followed other platforms and other station types.

Typical Network Architecture for different stations is given as: 

 

3.B.3.1 Deleted.  

 

3.B.3.2 Network Design for B Type stations 

  

Each B type station has typically 2 or 3 platforms.  Each platform will be having 3 to 4 nos. 

of 8 port PoE access switches (Type-I Switch). These access switches on each platform will 

connect to MPLS aggregation switch (Type-IV Switch) in a ring topology with 12 core single 

mode fiber. This ring topology will provide redundant path to access switches in case of fiber 

cut happens incidentally. Railtel backbone network will also be terminated on same aggrega-

tion switch. 

 

Network diagram for B type station is given as:

A separate VRF instance will be created on Type-IV Switch for different type of services 

(Surveillance, Wi-Fi etc). Access switches will separate these services in form of unique 

VLANs and maintain logical segregation between these services. This will maintain each 

service separately from traffic flow and QoS implementation perspective and improve net-

work performance along with securing and isolating these services from each other.  

 

A separate VRF instance may be created on Type-IV switch for Railway Police Force users 

in addition to mentioned services in B type station. Railway Police Force users will have a 

secure client for monitoring stations through IP surveillance cameras. 

 

This network architecture must have features like port security, DHCP snooping, Dynamic 

ARP inspection, IP Source guard, BPDU Guard and Spanning tree root guard. These features 

will enable network to implement first level of network security at these switches as a protec-

tion from sniffing and reconnaissance attacks. 

 

This network architecture must have loop avoiding feature like MSTP/RSTP to implement 

dual homing/redundancy successfully. 

 

IP Video Surveillance is traffic hungry and delay sensitive service. To ensure proper func-

tioning of this project, network architecture must have features like Multicast VLAN Regis-

tration, IP SLA, Auto-QoS, Auto Ports configuration to detect end device type connected to 

port and configuring QoS automatically on basis of device.  Network should have IPv4 and 

IPv6 port and time based access list with time ranges. 

 

 

3.B.3.3 Network Design for A Type stations 

 

Each A type station typically has 5 nos. of physical platforms. Each platform will be having a 

Type-II switch as an aggregation. These aggregation switches on each platform will connect 

to Type-IV switch available on stations in a ring topology with 24 core single mode fiber. 

This ring topology will provide redundant path to aggregation switches in case of fiber cut 

happens incidentally.

8 port PoE access switches will be deployed on each platform to cover full length of plat-

form. These access switches will connect to aggregation switch on each platform on 12 core 

single mode fiber. 4 core will be terminated at each access switch location and remaining 

core will spliced and lead to another access location. All access switches will form a star to-

pology with aggregation switch on each platform. Further IP Surveillance Cameras, Wi-Fi 

Access Points and Information Display Units will connect on Cat5e/Cat6 UTP cables to these 

access switches to provide various services.  

 

If there is requirement to connect access switches for platform extension, any other locations 

or any other services aggregation switches will have sufficient ports available. 

 

Each A type station typically has 5 platforms. Network architecture will be same as a type B 

station with additional coverage for increased nos. of platforms. Same set of aggregation and 

access switches on platforms will cover both platforms that are adjacent to each other.

Eligibility criteria related documents as applicable shall also be scanned and submitted 

ONLINE. Copy of these documents shall also be submitted in RailTel before Tender opening 

date & time. Bids without these off line submissions are liable to be rejected.  

 

4.B.10 Special Note on Security of Bids 

 

Security related functionality has been rigorously implemented in ETS in a multidimensional 

manner. Starting with 'Acceptance of Registration by the Service Provider', provision for se-

curity has been made at various stages in Electronic Tender’s software. Security related as-

pects as regard Bid Submission are outlined below: 

 

As part of the Electronic Encrypter™ functionality, the contents of both the ‘Electronic 

Forms’ and the ‘Main-Bid’ are securely encrypted using a Pass- Phrase created by the Bidder 

himself. Unlike a ‘password’, a Pass-Phrase can be a multi-word sentence with spaces be-



RailTel Corporation of India Limited     Tender No. RailTel/Tender/OT/CO/P/2017-

18/VSS/403 dated 24-11-17 

114 | P a g e  

   

tween words (e.g. I love this World). A Pass-Phrase is easier to remember, and more difficult 

to break. It is recommended that a separate Pass-Phrase be created for each Bid-Part. This 

method of bid-encryption does not have the security and data-integrity related vulnerabilities 

which are inherent in e-tendering systems which use Public-Key of the specified officer of a 

Buyer organization for bid-encryption. Bid-encryption in ETS is such that the Bids cannot be 

decrypted before the Public Online Tender Opening Event (TOE), even if there is connivance 

between the concerned tender-opening officers of the Buyer organization and the personnel 

of e-tendering service provider. 

 

Typically, ‘Pass-Phrase’of the Bid-Part to be opened during a particular Public Online Ten-

der Opening Event (TOE) is furnished online by each bidder during the TOE itself, when 

demanded by the concerned Tender Opening Officers who will open the bid. Else Tender 

Opening Officer may authorize the bidder to open his bid himself. There is an additional pro-

tection with SSL Encryption during transit from the client-end computer of a Supplier organ-

ization to the e-tendering server/ portal. 

 

(Mandatory Additional Methods of passphrase submission): 

 

Additionally, the bidder shall make sure that the Pass-Phrase to decrypt the relevant Bid Part 

is submitted to RailTel in a sealed envelope before the start date and time of the Tender 

Opening Event (TOE) along with other offline submissions. 

 

4.B.11 Public Online Tender Opening Event (TOE) 

 

ETS offers a unique facility for ‘Public Online Tender Opening Event (TOE)’. Tender Open-

ing Officers as well as authorized representatives of bidders can attend the Public Online 

Tender Opening Event (TOE) from the comfort of their offices. For this purpose, representa-

tives of bidders (i.e. Supplier organizations) dully authorized are requested to carry a Laptop 

and Wireless Connectivity to Internet.  

 

Every legal requirement for a transparent and secure ‘Public Online Tender Opening Event 

(TOE)’ has been implemented on ETS. As soon as a Bid is decrypted with the corresponding 

‘Pass-Phrase’ as submitted online by the bidder himself (during the TOE itself), salient points 

of the Bids are simultaneously made available for downloading by all participating bidders.  

 

ETS has a unique facility of ‘Online Comparison Chart’ which is dynamically updated as 

each online bid is opened. The format of the chart is based on inputs provided by the Buyer 

for each Tender. The information in the Comparison Chart is based on the data submitted by 

the Bidders in electronic forms. A detailed Technical and/ or Financial Comparison Chart 

enhances Transparency. Detailed instructions are given on relevant screens.  

 

ETS has a unique facility of a detailed report titled ‘Minutes of Online Tender Opening Event 

(TOE)’ covering all important activities of ‘Online Tender Opening Event (TOE)’. This is 

available to all participating bidders for ‘Viewing/ Downloading’.  

 

There are many more facilities and features on ETS. For a particular tender, the screens 

viewed by a Supplier will depend upon the options selected by the concerned Buyer. 

 

NOTE: In case of internet related problem at a bidder’s end, especially during ‘critical 

events’ such as - a short period before bid-submission deadline, during online public 



RailTel Corporation of India Limited     Tender No. RailTel/Tender/OT/CO/P/2017-

115 | P a g e  

   

tender opening event, during e-auction, it is the bidder’s responsibility to have backup 

internet connections. 

 

In case there is a problem at the e-procurement/ e-auction service provider’s end (in the serv-

er, leased line, etc) due to which all the bidders face a problem during critical events, and this 

is brought to the notice of RailTel by the bidders in time, then RailTel will promptly re-

schedule the affected event(s).

(https://www.tcil-india-electronictender.com), and go to the User-Guidance Center.

egories - Users intending to Register / First-Time Users, Logged-in users of Buyer organiza-

PRECAUTIONS TO BE TAKEN IN 25 KV A.C. TRACTION AREA:  

 

II.1.1 GENERAL 

 

  Any Telecommunication circuits in the vicinity of AC Traction running parallel to 25 

KV lines are liable to be affected by AC induced voltage. Therefore precautions 

should be taken to eliminate the possibility of induced voltage affecting equipment 

and humans.  

 

  Crossing of track, if any, should be negotiated by underground cables running at right 

angles to the track as far as practicable.  

 

  Special protective measures (viz. provision of G.D tubes, fuses and earthing etc) are 

required to be taken for telecommunication lines entering 25 KV sub-station 

/switching posts. 

 

  For the human safety considerations the safe working voltages should be 60 V  under 

normal conditions and 150 V with special precautions and 430 V under fault condi-

tions.  

 

  Instructions for protection of railway staff/working personals on signaling and tele-

communications installations on 25 kV AC traction shall be strictly adhered to. Pre-

cautions are required to be taken on account of following, 

 

i) Proximity of live conductor. 

ii) Pressure of return current in Rails.  

iii) Induction in all metallic bodies situated closed to over head     

     equipment.

PREPARATION OF AS-BUILT ROUTE PLANS 

 

II.2.0 SCOPE:  

 

The scope of this is to prepare a final set of As-Built drawings of route plans, based 

on the actual cable route (which in turn shall be based on a preliminary & approved 

drawings of route plans, already supplied to the contractor). 

 

II.2.1 Points to be taken care of for laying the OFC cable: 

 

II.2.1.1  Avoid underground structures, signaling cable, power cables and pipe lines 

etc. 

 

II.2.1.2  Avoid rodent/termite infested or infected side of the alignment. 

 

II.2.1.3  Avoiding areas prone to water logging. 

 

II.2.1.4  For the straight runs as far as possible   a   separation   of 10 Meter should be 

kept from the nearest track. This is as per CCITT recommendation K.8. 

 

 As a rule a minimum distance of 5.75 M should be maintained between the OHE 

masts and the cable. In Yards etc. where observance of this rule may be difficult, a 

minimum distance of 3 Meter should be maintained. In exceptional cases where the 

cable trench depth is less than 0.5 M the lateral distance may be reduced to 1 M. 

 Make the route of OFC cable within 1 meter of Railway boundary normally. 

 

 

II.2.2 As-Built Cable Route plan. 

 

Based on above actual route, the as-built cable route plan should be prepared: 

 

II.2.3 Preparation of Drawings

SECTION - II 

CHAPTER - 3 

 

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR TRENCHING AND 

LAYING OF OPTICAL FIBRE CABLE: 

 

II.3.1 SCOPE: 

 

This chapter deals with the specifications under which the various work for trenching 

& laying of optical fibre cable coming under the purview of the contract are to be ex-

ecuted by the contractor. 

 

II.3.2 SUPPLY OF ROUTE PLAN: 

 

Approved Cable Route plan and jointing schedule for mid section splicing of cable 

will be prepared and supplied by the RailTel This shall give a preliminary idea of the 

number & locations and the quantities and type of various equipment to be fixed, 

wired and commissioned.  

 

 

II.3.3 LEADING OF CABLE IN MASONRY BUILDINGS 

 

II.3.3.1 The cable will have to be led inside any masonry building such as Cable hut, ASM's 

room at a depth of 0.75 meters by cutting the masonry structure of the wall as per 

Drg.No. RE/S&T/ALD/SK/161/81 as given at Annexure- 3.12. After the cable has 

been led inside the masonry wall, the floor inside shall be duly repaired and plastered. 

 

II.3.4  LAYING OF CABLE IN SPECIAL CASES: 

 

II.3.4.1  Near Power Cable 

 

When the proposed cable route comes across any other cable already laid, the contrac-

tor shall first report the fact to the Engineer. Should the cable be identified by the En-

gineer as a power cable (LT or HT), the trench shall be dug as far away from the route 

of the power cable as practicable. 

 

II.3.4.2 Crossing of Optical Fibre Cable with another cable 

  

Crossing of the Optical Fibre cable with another cable shall be avoided wherever pos-

sible. Where, however, this is not possible, the Optical Fibre cable shall be laid in 

cement or asbestos cement pipes. The length of the pipe to be provided on either side 

of the crossing shall be atleast one meter. 

 

II.3.4.3 Laying other than optical fibre cables in the same Trench 

 

No cable other than quad cable shall be laid in the trench made for the Optical Fibre 

cable. Even in such cases, both the cables are to be laid as per approved drawing. 

Where, however, exceptional circumstances exist, the optical fibre cable may be laid 

along with another cable in the same trench provided a specific permission of each 

such case is obtained in writing from Engineer. When optical fibre cable and L.T. 

power cable have to be laid in the same trench they shall be separated by placing a

231 | P a g e  

   

layer of second class bricks between them vertically  (approx. 16 bricks/meter) or laid 

in RCC pipe. 

 

II.3.4.4 Laying of cable through RCC/GI/DWC pipes 

  

The cable shall be laid through RCC/GI/DWC pipes at the locations marked on the 

route plan and as advised by the Engineer or his representative. 

  

For laying the cable through pipes galvanised steel wires of a cross section not less 

than 10 SWG shall be used as a lead wire. Two such lengths of wires shall be laid 

through the pipes, so  that after the cable is threaded through the pipe, one lead wire is 

permanently left in the pipe with a suitable overlay at two ends, to enable the cable to 

be pulled out at a later stage if required to do so. 

  

On arch bridges and culvert bridges the cables will be threaded through DWC pipes 

etc. While threading the cable through these pipes the Contractor shall do the trench-

ing to the required depth wherever necessary for which no extra charge will be paid. 

 

II.3.4.5 Laying cable near feeding post: 

 

In the vicinity of feeding posts, as far as possible the cable shall be laid on the side of 

the track opposite to the feeding post. Further the Optical fibre cable shall be at least 

one metre away from any metallic part of the  O.H.E. and other equipment at the sub 

station which is fixed on the ground and at least one metre away from the sub - station 

earthing. In addition, the cable shall be laid in RCC pipes 150 mm dia (standard 2 me-

tre length) complete or capable of being split into two half as per specn. No. ISS-458 

latest for a length of 300 metres on either side of the feeding point.  

 

II.3.4.6  Running of cables at foundations others than OHE Masts and from pipe out-

lets. 

 

Damages to cable is likely to occur if care is not taken in laying cable where the bed 

changes from solid support such as a foundation pipe or bridge to soft support such as 

soft soil. The cable must not press against the edge of the solid support. The soft soil 

near the edge must be tamped and the cable raised slightly. 

 

II.3.5 HANDLING OF CABLE DRUMS & PAYING OF CABLES: 

 

II.3.5.1 While collecting OFC/HDPE from RailTel depot the contractor must ensure that the 

materials should be received in good condition. The drums shall be unloaded by the 

side of the Railway Track/Road from either a crane or any other suitable means very 

carefully so as not to cause any damage to the cable. The drums at site shall be pro-

tected until they are laid. The cable must be tested before and after laying. 

 

II.3.5.2 On each drum there are two ends, A & B. The 'B' end of one cable length shall meet 

'A' end of the next cable at a joint. The 'A' end shall be normally on the top unless in-

dicated otherwise on a drum. 

 

II.3.5.3 The drums shall always be kept upright, i.e. axle in parallel position to the base. The 

drums shall not be set by jerks but shall be handled slowly and with care. The walls of 

the drums should not be damaged while moving the drums if required for unrolling. 



RailTel Corporation of India Limited     Tender No. RailTel/Tender/OT/CO/P/2017-

18/VSS/403 dated 24-11-17 

232 | P a g e  

   

 

II.3.5.4 The drums shall normally be unrolled at the same place and the cable carried by 

workmen near the trench. The drums shall not be dragged in any case. But where 

drums of cable have to be moved, would always  be rolled in the direction of the ar-

row, otherwise the coils tend to unwind and the cable may get battered. In case no di-

rection arrow is marked on the drum, remove several battens and determine the direc-

tion in which the cable is coiled. The arrow should then be painted on the drum point-

ing in the opposite direction in which the upper cable end is coiled so that future han-

dling of the cable drum is facilitated and then replace the battens carefully. 

 

II.3.5.5 The drum should be properly mounted on jacks (or on a cable wheel) making sure 

that the spindle is large enough to carry the weight without bending and that it is lay-

ing horizontally in the bearings so as to prevent the drum creeping to one side or the 

other while it is rotating. Before attempting to pull off the cable, remove the end pro-

tection box attached to the flange of the drum and cut the security ropes so as to leave 

the cable free to move.  

 

II.3.5.6 If a portion of the cable only is taken out from the cable drum, the battens should be 

immediately replaced to prevent damage to the balance of the cable. This is im-

portant. 

 

II.3.5.7 The use of steel bars between the bolt heads to 'jump' or turn the drum around is dan-

gerous to staff and likely to damage the drums. A better method is to use two steel 

plates with grease between them. By standing the drum on these greased plates, it can 

be easily elevated round to the desired position. 

 

II.3.5.8 All care should be taken in handling cable drums with a view to ensure safety not on-

ly of the cables but also of the working party handling them. The man should not be 

allowed to brake the cable drum by standing in front but only from side. 

 

II.3.5.9  Rewinding and Redrumming of cables. 

 

(a) If for any reason it is found necessary to rewind a cable on a drum, cable   

drum with a proper barrel diameter not less than of the original drum should 

be chosen. 

  

(b) The drums should be mounted on cable jacks during rewinding operations us-

ing proper size of spindles passed through the flange holes, which will not 

buckle under the lead. The cable should not be bent opposite to the set it is 

having already. 

 

(c) In the re-drumming operations, drums should be so turned that the cable pass-
es from the bottom of the original set with as little gap as possible. 

 

(d) Replace all the lagging on the cable drum. 

 

II.3.6  MINIMUM BENDING RADIUS: 

 

Cables should always be bent (or straightened) slowly, they should never be bent to 

small radius while handling. The minimum safe bending radius for optical fibre  ca-

bles should be 30 times the diameter of the cable but wherever possible larger radius 

should be used.

JOINTING AND TERMINATION OF FIBRE OPTIC CABLE 

 

II.4.1    TECHNIQUE FOR JOINTING OF OPTICAL FIBRE CABLE 

 

 Fusion splicing shall be used for splicing fibres. This is accomplished by applying 

localized heating (i.e. by electric arc or flame) at the interface between two butted, 

pre-aligned fibre ends, causing them to soften and fuse together. 

 

II.4.2 STRAIGHT JOINT FOR FIBRE OPTIC CABLE 

 

II.4.2.1  There are various types of joint enclosures available in the market. The proce-

dure for assembly of joint closure is described in the installation manual supplied with 

straight joint closure. This includes the following: 

 

Material inside joint closure kit 

 

Installation tools required 

 

Detailed procedure for cable jointing 

 

Procedure for re-opening the closure. 

 

II.4.2.2  The Optic Fibre straight through joint closure shall be as per specn. TEC TO 

910 G92 (latest) or a proven design approved by RCIL .The joint shall be protected in 

RCC Joint Pit  as per drawing given in Annexure 2.14. (.The Optic Fibre straight 

through joint closure shall be of TVSE, R&M, Raychem, 3M make and shall be ap-

proved in advance by RailTel.  The joint shall be protected in concrete chamber as 

approved by engineer- in-charge. ) 

 

II.4.2.3   Generally, the following steps are involved for jointing of the cable: 

 

       - Preparation of cable for jointing 

       - Stripping/cutting the cable 

       - Preparation of Cable and joint closure for  splicing 

       - Stripping and Cleaving of Fibres 

       - Fibre splicing 

       - Organising fibres and Finishing joints 

       - Sealing of joint closure and 

       - Placing  joint in  the Jointing Chamber/Pit. 

 

II.4.3  STRIPPING/CUTTING OF THE CABLE 

 

  The cables are stripped of their outer and inner sheath with each sheath staggered ap-

proximately 10mm from the one above it. 

 



RailTel Corporation of India Limited     Tender No. RailTel/Tender/OT/CO/P/2017-

18/VSS/403 dated 24-11-17 

235 | P a g e  

   

 Proper care must be taken when removing the inner sheath to ensure the fibres are not 

scratched or cut with the stripping knife or tool. To prevent this, it is best to only 

score the inner sheath twice on opposite sides of the cable, rather than cut completely 

through it. The two scores marking on either side of the cable are then stripped of the 

inner sheath by hand quite easily. 

 

   The fibres are then removed from cable one by one and each fibre is cleaned individu-

ally using Kerosene to remove the jelly. 

 

II.4.4  STRIPPING AND CLEAVING OF FIBRE 

 

Prior to splicing each fibre must have approximately 50mm of its primary protective 

U.V. cured coating removed, using fibre stripper which are manufactured to fine tol-

erances and only score the coating without contacting the glass fibre. 

 

The bare fibre is then wiped with a lint free tissue doused with ethyl alcohol. Cleaving 

of the fibre is then performed to obtain as close as possible to a perfect 90 degree face 

on the fibre. 

  

II.4.5 SPLICING OF THE FIBRES 

 

The fusion splicing shall be used for fibre splicing. Some of the basic steps for fusion 

splicing are as given in 4.8 below. 

 

II.4.6  FUSION SPLICING OF FIBRE 

 

Some of the general steps with full automatic micro processor control splicing ma-

chine are as under  

 

Wash hands thoroughly prior to commencing this procedure. 

 

Dip the clean bare fibre in the beaker of ethyl alcohol of the ultrasonic cleaver. Switch 

on ultrasonic cleaver for 5-10 seconds (Some of the manufacturers do not prescribe 

the above cleaning). 

 

Place the bare fibre inside 'V' grove of the splicing machine by opening clamp handle 

such that the end of fibre is app. 1 mm. over the end of the "V" groove towards the 

electrodes. 

 

Repeat the same procedure for other fibre, however, first insert heat shrink splice pro-

tector. 

 

Press the start button on the splice controller. 

 

The machine will pre fuse, set align both in 'X' and 'Y' direction and than finally fuse 

the fibre. 

 

Inspect the splice on monitor if provided on the fusion splicing machine and assure no 

nicking, bulging is there and cores appear to be adequately aligned. If the splice does 

not visually look good repeat the above procedure.

Slide the heat shrink protector over the splice and place in tube heater. Heat is com-

plete when soft inner layer is seen to be 'oozing' out of the ends of the outer layer of 

the protector. 

 

Repeat for other fibres. 

 

II.4.7   FUSION SPLICER AND OTDR

II.4.8  ORGANISING FIBRE AND FINISHING JOINTS 

 

After each fibre is spliced, the heat shrink protection sleeve must be slipped over the 

bare fibre before any handling of fibre takes place, as uncoated fibres are very brittle 

and cannot withstand small radius bends without breaking. 

 

The fibre is then organized into its tray by coiling the fibres on each side of the pro-

tection sleeve using the full tray side to ensure the maximum radius possible for fibre 

coils. 

 

The tray are placed in the position. 

 

OTDR reading taken for all splices in this organized state and recorded on the test 

sheet to confirm that all fibres attenuation are within specification. This OTDR test 

confirms fibres were not subjected to excessive stress during the organizing process. 

 

After this the joint can be closed with necessary sealing etc. and ready for placement 

in the pit.

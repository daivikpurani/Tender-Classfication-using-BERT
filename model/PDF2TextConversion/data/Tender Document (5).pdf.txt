7. Ownership Definition 

7.1. Circle_CAF_Owner: The person shall be from the CMTS cell. He shall be responsible for 
getting the CAF scanned for the entire circle. The invoice payment shall be the 
responsibility of this person. Backup of the complete data shall be the responsibility of 
Circle_CAF_Owner. Backup to be taken on weekly basis. The name, contact number of 
the person at the circle level, with whom the vendor has to co-ordinate shall be entered in 
the software.  

7.2. SSA_CAF_Owner: This person shall be responsible for getting the CAF scanned for the 
entire SSA/Area. The name, contact number of the person at SSA level/ Area Manager 
shall be entered in the software. 

7.3. POCAF_Owner: POCAF stands for Point of CAF. Each point where CAF exist should 
have an owner defined who shall be responsible of getting the CAF scanned within his 
jurisdiction. The name, contact number of person shall be entered in the software in 
proper hierarchy. For example, in an SDCA if CAF are submitted, then POCAF_Owner 
has to be defined for the SDCA. Similarly if an SSA HQ is having, say, four CSC where 
CAF are collected, four POCAF_Owner are to be defined. If the DSA/franchise is 
submitting the CAF to some person in SSA HQ, then a separate POCAF_Owner has to be 
defined. Even if same person is taking CAF for BSNL and for 
Franchise/dealer/distributer, he should have different POCAF_Owner ID. Each 
POCAF_Owner shall have a separate ID and password. The person shall co-ordinate with 
customer/ franchise/DSA for getting the rejected form complete in all respects. The ID of 
the person shall be available with each CAF data. The more the number of this ID, the 
better will be the data. In case of any confusion, plan for more number of ID. 

7.4. As per the regulatory requirement, letter No 800-4/2003-VAS (Vol.III) (Pt.III) dated 
13.09.2007 issued by ADG(VAS-1) of DOT, it should be possible to trace from which 
CSC/ Dealer/ Distributer/ DSA, the CAF was collected. 

7.5. SSA_QC_Owner: The person will be responsible for checking 100% CAF after the full 
LOT is ready in all aspects, and is ready for uploading. The ID of this person shall be 
entered in the software. 

7.6. The vendor is free to upload the data of a LOT/CAF in the server at any stage, as required 
by the  workflow.

8.1. The minimum of the following masters shall be defined in the software. 

8.2. Circle Master 

8.3. SSA Master 

8.4. SDCA Master. 

8.5. Agency Master. This shall have the data for all the franchises/ dealer/ distributer/ DSA of 
the entire circle.  The data should be created carefully. The IDs already given to them have 
to be maintained. If required, new ID may be given, but the mapping between the old ID 
and new ID should be intact as the CAF will have the old ID. 

8.6. As per the regulatory requirement, letter No 800-4/2003-VAS (Vol.III) (Pt.III) dated 
13.09.2007 issued by ADG(VAS-1) of DOT, it should be possible to trace from which 
CSC/ Dealer/ Distributer/ DSA, the CAF was collected. To meet this requirement proper 
hierarchy and ownerships have to be defined. 

8.7. Box master: The Box number, mapped with SSA shall be entered. 

8.8. Rack master: The racks should be numbered and the mapping with box shall be done. The 
idea is that, it should be possible to get the exact rack and

8.11. The linking of master data with one another should be made wherever possible to have 
best data integrity. 

 

9. Storing of CAF 

9.1. All the CAFs shall be finally stored at the SSA HQ. 

9.2. The vendor shall also provide Corrugated Cardboard Boxes of Uniform Size 13’’X 10.5’’X 
12.5’’ for storing of the scanned CAF. The box should be of corrugated paper of 7 ply. The 
numbering scheme on the boxes shall be provided by BSNL. The numbering nomenclature 
is attached as Annexure-1. The file ‘cdr-zone-circle-ssa-sdca-list-ver.2.0.xls’ is enclosed 
where the codes for circles, ssa have been defined by ITPC. The metro circles can use the 
area code instead of ssa code wherever required. 

9.3. This box can store about 550 CAF. 

9.4. After the SSA_CAF_Owner, is satisfied with the scanned images and sample check has 
been done, the vendor will put the LOT of 550 completed forms in the box and hand over 
this to the SSA_CAF_Owner. 

9.5. The boxes should be numbered. The vendor has to provide A4 size sticker. The box 
number has to be written on all four sides. Hence for each box, 4 A4 size stickers shall be 
provided by vendor. 

9.6. This box number should also be entered in the data to be entered with each form. 

9.7. This box will then be handed over to SSA_CAF_Owner, after which it shall be the 
responsibility of the SSA_CAF_Owner to keep the Box in an appropriate place. 

9.8. This place shall be a secure place, and should be made termite free. Rodent treatments of 
this place should be done on monthly basis. It should also have the necessary fire fighting 
arrangements. 

9.9. In case the SSA is not having a predefined CAF storage facility, Steel Racks of size 96’’X 
36’’X 15’’ can be used for keeping these boxes for Easy Retrieval of Records. In one line 4 
boxes can be kept, and total of five lines can be there in one rack. Hence in one rack 20 
boxes can be accommodated. 

9.10. The numbering system of the rack should also be defined in the software. This numbering 
should come from the rack master. 

 

10. Scanning workflow and methodology 

10.1. The work flow is attached as Annexure-2. 

10.2. The CAF which are ready for scanning should be submitted by POCAF_Owner in a LOT. 
The LOT size shall be 550 because the box of the defined size can accommodate 550 
forms. 

10.3. Whenever the owner of POCAF is ready with 550 CAFs for scanning, the owner of 
POCAF shall log in the software and initiate a new ‘LOT’ in the software. 

10.4. The owner at the POCAF should enter only the mobile numbers from the CAF. The 
software should generate 10 text boxes for entering mobile numbers on one page. There 
should be button, save and add more at the bottom, which will save the 10 records, the

date of entry, LOT number and the ID of POCAF_Owner and open a fresh page with 10 
text box. 

10.5. When 550 mobile numbers are added, the software will give an indication, and will close 
the LOT. The total number of mobile numbers entered in the LOT should be shown on 
the top of page where data entry is done. 

10.6. A typical work flow can be as under 

10.6.1. The POCAF at all level, shall make LOTS. Attempt should be made to scan the most 
recent CAF first. LIFO.  But in no way, the scanning has to stop.  

10.6.2. All the LOTs should be handed over to the SSA_CAF_Owner, with proper sign off. 
This should  be also reflected in the software. 

10.6.3. Once the LOT is received is ready with SSA_CAF_Owner, it should be handed to 
vendor and  after that it shall be shown pending for scanning. 

10.6.4. The responsibility of taking all CAF to SSA_CAF_Owner will be of BSNL. 
10.6.5. The Vendor shall scan the LOT, and check the quality of the image. 
10.6.6. The scanning shall be done in PDF format (colored). The soft copy of CAF which are 

scanned in PDF format will be converted to TIF format without any extra charges in 
future, if required. The page containing the photo and signature should only be scanned.  

10.6.7. The vendor has to make folders in the local computer where image data is stored. The 
folder name shall be the LOT number. The image shall be stored in PDF  (colored)format. 
The file name shall be mobile number followed by underscore followed by date (defined in 
next Para). For example 9400000356_02082007. The file number should be of 19 
characters; hence zero should be added before dd and mm wherever required. This will take 
care of duplicate mobile number due to number reuse. 

10.6.8. Date is very important. The date that shall be entered in the data shall be (priority wise) 
10.6.8.1. Date of activation, mostly available for post paid. 
10.6.8.2. Date of sale of SIM, i.e. if one sells a prepaid connection, he will write the date 

on which  this connection is sold. This date shall be considered. 
10.6.8.3. If the above two dates are not available, then any reasonable date available on 

the CAF can be entered. 
10.6.8.4. If any of three is not available, the SSA_CAF_Owner can decide any suitable 

date, as per the available bundle, as per SIM number or whatever. Attempt 
should be made not to stop the scanning process. 

10.6.8.5. Very important aspect with respect to date is that, there should be a list of 
values provided which should indicate which type of date is entered. 

10.6.8.6. Whenever data is retrieved, the date selection criterion should also be taken, so 
that proper information is conveyed. 

10.7. The vendor will also do the data entry for each CAF in the software. The data that is to be 
entered is mobile number and any of Date as defined above with the priority indicated. 
After submitting this data, a window will open that will collect the matching data from the 
data provided by the Zonal B&CCS. The idea is that the account number of the mobile 
number which is being scanned should be paired. The data that this application software 
will get from the billing data dump shall be displayed.  First name, last name, date of 
activation, account number will be displayed. A check box against each shall be displayed. 
The vendor has to select the matching check box and submit. The data that shall be finally 
stored in the server shall be 

10.7.1. Mobile number  -- (To be entered by vendor, or one by one from the LOT) 
10.7.2. Date (as above, any one date)  -- (To be entered by vendor)

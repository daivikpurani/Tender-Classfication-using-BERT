3. Objectives of Digitization 
 

The need for preservation, coupled with need for improving accessibility (which 
can only be achieved by digital storage and an efficient database management 
retrieval system) is the need for the High Court and District Courts in the States of

archives. 

 
In view of the above, the primary objectives of the proposed initiative are:

Once the documents are scanned and digitized, preservation of the original 
can be ensured for a much longer period as the need to handle the physical 
documents would be eliminated or minimized to a great extent since digital 
document would be made available through the DMS Software. 

 
b) Accessibility and Availability - The DMS would make the District Courts of 

holdings more accessible to end users, both within the District Courts of 
premises as well as those who cannot personally visit the District Courts of 
Punjab, Haryana & U.T., Chandigarh. Even if only the metadata is made 
available on the internet / intranet in the first phase, this will greatly improve 
the speed and convenience of accessing documents and information held by 
the District Courts of Punjab, Haryana & U.T., Chandigarh. 

 
c) Enhance Search ability - All holdings would be linked based on subjects, 

keywords, notes or any other criteria making a tremendous amount of data 
easily available on any subject matter. 

 
d) Electronically sending of memos / circulars to other Courts and various State / 

Central Government departments within quick spell of time with the help of 
Internet / Intranet. 

 
e) Creating catalogue and portfolio of the scanned case files and other records.

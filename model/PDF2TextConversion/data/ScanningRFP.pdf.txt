PROJECT BACKGROUND 

 

The Transport Department, Government of Maharashtra has undertaken various e-Governance 

initiatives relating to Grant / Renewal of Driving Licenses, Registration of Motor Vehicle etc. 

These e-Governance initiatives have been implemented since 2006 and are primarily 

categorized under 2 applications developed by NIC: 

 

 SARATHI: Application for issuance and transaction management of Driving License (DL) 
related services. In this system, the applicant’s details like signature, photograph, thumb 

impression etc. are captured as part of service delivery process. 

 VAHAN: Application for delivering Vehicle Registration Certificate (RC) related services. 
In this system, the vehicle details & owner details are captured. 

 

As explained above, these systems have come into effect post 2006. Hence, the records prior 

to implementation of these systems are predominantly manual records, in hand written form, 

primarily maintained as registers of A3 / A4 size (spanning one or more pages per record in 

register) and in few cases in A5 sized cards. Being physical papers, the condition of these 

records has deteriorated in course of regular operations and time. Further, as they are manual 

records, search and retrieval of records is a very time-consuming exercise and not efficient. 

Hence, for the long term preservation and for efficient retrieval, department proposes to scan 

and digitize these records. 

 

Additionally, to ensure availability of records even in case of disaster, the backup copy of 

scanned documents needs to be maintained to ensure that even if original copy is lost then the 

scanned copy may be recovered from backup. 

 

With above focus and to supplement its current initiatives in e-Governance, Department of 

Transport (DoT), Government of Maharashtra wishes to undertake state-wide initiative for 

Scanning and Digitization of these legacy records, held at various Transport Offices in manual 

form. 

 

Objectives of the project 

The main objective of this project is to preserve the physical records maintained at Transport 

Offices by scanning, and to make them electronically searchable. The department wishes to 

achieve the following through this project: 

 Provide integrated services w.r.t vehicle registration and licensing of drivers. 

 Reduce information dissemination time. 

 Make data available for analysis & decision making at the appropriate time. 

 Introduce faster & efficient consolidation and generation of information. 

 Reduce manual communication and information delays. 

 Bring transparency in day-to-day operations of the department. 

 Provide facility of quick retrieval of the scanned and digitized records for better decision 
making. 

 

At the end of this initiative the following should be possible: 

 An Electronic search and retrieval of department’s records based on key fields. 

 An Electronic search of transactions pertaining to Driving License and Motor Vehicle on 
the basis of key fields like Vehicle Number, Driving License Number, etc. 

 Availability of key-fields within records in electronic form so that the data regarding non-
key fields which are skipped from this project may be entered during regular operation. 

 Updation of databases of vehicles and licenses (VAHAN and SARATHI) by the records 
digitized under the program after due validation by the concerned authority. 

 Access of the records for on-ground enforcement by MVD / Traffic officials.

Phase II - Pre-Scanning 

 

Prior to scanning process, there are number of activities that need to be carried out so that the 

documents are properly handled and not lost / misplaced / damaged. The steps in this stage of 

the process are as follows: 

 

Records / Register Collection 

 

 The Successful Bidder will collect all records / registers mentioned in the scope of work 

from the RTO official from the office of RTO or any other place as directed by MVD. It 

will maintain physical log to record details of records / registers collected and returned. The 

following indicative details should be entered into the log register:

Records Preparation / Repair 

 

 Prior to handing over the records for scanning to the Successful Bidder, MVD will affix a 

running serial number to each document and maintain record of the same. 

 Further, it is not necessary that all the pages in a records will have an identifier (Vehicle 

Number, License Number etc.) 

 Successful Bidder needs to ensure proper un-filing and re-filing in absence of such 

reference numbers on each page of a record. 

 The records so received shall be prepared and repaired by the Successful Bidder. 

 Document handling, scanning and re-submission of the documents must be carried out in a 

manner to ensure that the documents are not damaged and no further deterioration takes 

place. Trimming, tearing or cutting of the Case files / pages is not permitted. 

 In case of damage to the records, penalties as defined in SLA as per Annexure XI will be 

applicable. 

 

Indicative list of activities to be performed for records preparation by Successful Bidder: 

 

 Dusting the files to remove dirt and other possible noise causing particles. 

 Removal of stapler pins, clips etc. (this should not lead to further deterioration of the 
documents). Also successful Bidder needs to ensure proper sequence of the document on 

removing stapler pins etc. 

 Repair the documents for scanning using cello-tape (Self-Adhesive clear Tapes) or 
enclosing the documents in plastic pouches (depending on the condition of the documents). 

 Successful Bidder shall take guidance from the RTO officials on files which needs to be 
defiled or where stapler pins / clips should be removed. 

 In case a file is defiled for purpose of scanning, Successful Bidder in consultation with 
MVD shall re-file the same in proper sequence before returning. 

 

Pre-Scanning Document Quality Check 

 

The Successful Bidder shall conduct quality check before sending any record for scanning. All 

the records need to go through quality check. It is more of a visual quality check of the records 

for visibility, readability. 

 

The following things should also be checked: 

 

 It should be checked that all records have been numbered 

 It should be noted that all pages have a record identifier 

 It should also be checked that they are not cloth mounted, torn or ragged, and not have too 
many folds. In case of folds, they should be straightened properly to be scanning ready. 

 It should be seen that they are dust free. 

 It should be checked that all damaged documents have been repaired. 
  



 

Page 32 of 87 

Phase III: Scanning and Data Entry 

 

After the above preparations of records they shall be processed for scanning and data entry. 

 

Pre-entry Verification Check 
 

 The Successful Bidder will carry out a pre-entry verification check through the software it 

develops which is integrated with NIC database / tool through web service provided by NIC 

to identify whether the legacy record already exists in Vahan or Sarathi database. 

 Necessary one-time support will be provided by MVD and NIC for integrating such tool 

through web service. 

 Only those records which do not exist in Vahan or Sarathi database as confirmed by the 

pre-entry verification shall be selected for scanning and data entry process. 

 The structure of web service will be shared with Successful Bidder at a later stage. 

 

Scanning of Records  

 

 Only those records which are not available in NIC’s database needs to be scanned and 

digitized. 

 The textual records (except bound registers) may be scanned by using flatbed scanner / 

book scanner. The choice of scanner should depend completely on the condition of the 

document. 

 Sheet Fed scanner shall only be used for excellent physical condition records. 

 In case the document is heavily torn and cannot be fed in the sheet feeder, then flat-bed 

scanner should be used. In case, the document cannot be scanned using any type of scanner, 

digital cameras can be used as image capturing device (In such case, DMS software must 

have provision to accommodate images captured from digital cameras). 

 The bound registers are to be scanned mandatorily by book scanner. 

 The scanning of the documents would be carried out in the respective RTO / Dy. RTO / TC 

office premises or MVD approved premises only. 

 The documents (records) shall not be taken out of RTO / Dy. RTO / TC office under any 

circumstances, unless duly directed and authorized by MVD. 

 The place at the respective RTO offices where the scanning would be carried out will be 

fully equipped with the required scanners, computers, internet connection, UPS / generators 

etc., for un-interrupted execution of the project by the Successful Bidder. 

 The necessary infrastructure for scanning needs to be setup by the Successful Bidder in the 

space provided by the concerned RTO / Dy. RTO / TC office. 

 Minimum specifications of the hardware infrastructure, including scanners shall be as per 

Annexure IV. 

 

Quality Parameters for scanned images 
 

 Minimum 200 DPI in Grayscale. In case legibility of the characters is not proper, the 

Successful Bidder shall scan the page as it is at higher DPI, not more than 300 DPI. However, 

the size of the image scanned (per side of a page) should not exceed 150 KB. 

 Image should be stored in PDF/A (ISO 19005-1:2005 or later) format only and shall be 

scanned in Grayscale only. 

 In case the scanned image is not legible in grayscale, the Successful Bidder may be required 

to scan it in colour mode. 

 Multiple images of multiple pages for single record shall be combined in single PDF/A file 

per record as the scanning for that particular record is completed. 



 

Page 33 of 87 

 Adequate compression should be applied to the scanned image such that image quality is 

not adversely affected substantially yet there is a saving on storage required. 

 Image should be oriented either vertically or horizontally (Portrait or Landscape) in such a 

manner to read the details on it without further need of rotation and should be without any 

tilt / skew. 

 Blank page should not be scanned. In case of doubt, successful bidder can take decision on 

the ground in consultation with RTO official. 

 Brightness and contrast of a scanned image should be considered wisely. If needed, 

Successful Bidder shall adjust the same for all the data on the page to be clearly legible. 

 Images should be scanned in such a way that printout of image on paper will be clean and 

legible on 1:1 scale. 

 The PDF/A file shall be appendable in future for more number of scanned image as and 

when required. This feature should be made available in module of MVD as well along with 

Successful Bidder’s module. 

 With respect to image, following points needs to be considered 

o The image should be clean and free of noise. 
o The image should not be warped. 
o Image should not have any shear. 
o Image should not contain black borders. 
o The image should not be too dark / too light, but dark enough for all data to be clearly 

legible. 

o The image should not have been captured under improper lighting, no shadow of any 
object should be on image. 

o The image (actual data on page) should not be cropped from any side. 
o The orientation of the image should be right so as to view directly without rotation later. 
o The image should not be skewed or blurred. 
o There should not be any data loss especially due to folds. 
o There should not be any data loss due to tight binding and bulge at the centre. 
o There should not be extra darkness at the edges. 
o There should not be unwanted black lines, images of fingers or any other unwanted 

disturbances on the scanned images. 

 

Note:  

 While scanning, the sheet has to be fed in straight upright position and smoothened so that 

no folds are generated while scanning. In the flat-bed scanner, the document has to be laid 

flat on the glass, smoothened and scanned; and bulging should be avoided. 

 In case of scanned image is not of desired quality, Successful Bidder shall scan it again until 

the desired quality is achieved (At no extra cost). 

 In case the documents are not legible, it will be the Successful Bidder’s responsibility to 

scan the documents at higher resolution. 

 The image so generated after adequate compression should be legible in both soft format 

and printed copy taken on paper in 1:1 scale. 

 The generated file should be optimized for viewing over the internet i.e. pages should be 

viewable as soon as they are downloaded without waiting for complete file to be downloaded 

i.e. A multipage file is downloaded page-by-page and should be viewable as soon as a page 

is downloaded rather than having to wait for the entire file to download. 

 The scanned documents should adhere to Indian IT Act 2000 (and amendments), Indian 

Evidence Act (and amendments).

NIC. 

 

  



 

Page 35 of 87 

Quality Check of Scanned Images 

 

Quality check after scanning is of utmost importance. Images clearing this QC will lead to 

movement of records to metadata entry phase. QC activities in this stage are: 

 

 The Successful Bidder should also check that all records obtained from the MVD have been 
scanned. No page has been scanned twice or if not designated by RTO official. Payment 

for such extra scanning will not be made to the Successful Bidder. 

 The Successful Bidder shall generate a report which identifies any mismatch between the 
number of records submitted for scanning and number of records actually scanned. 

 Successful Bidder should check scanned records for DPI, image quality, format, noise 
removal, legibility etc. 

 It is the absolute responsibility of the Successful Bidder to ensure that the content of 
scanned image is an exact replica of the original paper page. Images should be scrutinized 

by Successful Bidder in detail for any other kind of issue in the scanned images. 

 100% on-screen validation to be done and the log for 100% QC work done by Successful 
Bidder on daily basis. 

 The Successful Bidder will appoint skilled and qualified manpower for QC purpose and 
not get QC done by operators who have scanned and done metadata entry. 

 Successful Bidder will maintain a log on the DMS software application of all the records 
which have been rejected in 1st level QC by Successful Bidder. 

 In case there are issues with the scanned images, Successful Bidder will rescan all such 
pages again and take them for 2nd level QC. 

 Post 100% QC by Successful Bidder, the MVD will conduct random and surprise quality 
checks of the work carried out by the Successful Bidder. Any deviation shall attract the 

applicable penalties as per SLAs as defined in Annexure XI. 

 The Successful Bidder shall provide a QC module which is accessible online (for QC of 
scanned images and data by RTO officials) within the module of application for MVD. 

 The QC module shall have ‘approve’ and ‘reject’ buttons. In case the records are rejected 
in QC module, either by Successful Bidder or by MVD, the same record needs to be 

scanned once again with required and desired quality. The earlier scanned file created shall 

then be deleted from the DMS system. If the record is QC approved, only then it will be 

accessible in the DMS. 

 QC has to be done as per the quality expected from the Successful Bidder as defined in 
clause 3.2.1 under “Scope of Work” 

 

Handover of Records (back to RTO official) 

 

 After scanning, all the records should be handed over back to the RTO official in proper 

sequence and pinned or stapled promptly. Appropriate entries would also have to be made 

by the Successful Bidder and RTO official in their inward / outward register on return of 

documents. 

 Scanned records will be stamped and duly signed by the users indicating that the "FILE IS 

SCANNED AND DULY RECONSTRUCTED" and the Successful Bidder will be fully 

responsible for any loss/damage of any document. 

 Under no circumstances shall the records be changed, mutilated, destroyed or replaced by 

some other records. Any damage to the records will lead to penalties to the Successful 

Bidder as per SLAs as defined in Annexure XI. Thus the Successful Bidder should take 

utmost care of the records taken for scanning.

 Required space for metadata entry process shall be responsibility of the Successful Bidder. 

In case MVD provides space in one or more RTO offices, Successful Bidder shall do the 

data-entry execution at the MVD provided premises. In any case, necessary arrangements 

like physical infrastructure of desktops etc. and manpower for data entry either at 

Successful Bidder’s premises or MVD’s premises shall be responsibility of Successful 

Bidder. 

 

 If for one or more RTO, MVD doesn’t provide space, the metadata entry process for such 

RTO offices can be carried out from any desired location of Successful Bidder. The 

Successful Bidder shall provide for all physical infrastructure and manpower at each 

locations where metadata entry is being done. 

 

 However, all such locations where metadata entry process is being done outside MVD’s 

premises, the same has to be updated with MVD as a part of Project Planning and 

Management Document. 

 

 Any change in location address etc. shall be intimated to MVD by Successful Bidder. Also, 

total manpower strength and number of desktop terminals kept at each such location shall 

be intimated to MVD from time to time, up to date. 

 

 MVD or any other authorised officer at its sole discretion without any prior intimation to 

Successful Bidder may visit any of such location any time throughout the contract period. 

 

Double Blind Data Entry Method 

 For accurate metadata entry of key fields, double blind data entry method (i.e. two people 
will enter the data for the same scanned image independently), shall be done for all scanned 

images. 

 

 Metadata entry of key fields is to be done by adding appropriate tags to each scanned 
document in consultation with MVD. 

 

 The metadata entries of key fields done by these operators will be compared by the 
application and those with wrong metadata entry will be visible to the concerned supervisor 

of Successful Bidder. 

 

 Successful Bidder should correct all such errors at no extra cost or reassign the data entry 
again by double blind method to the data entry operators. 

 

 The Successful Bidder will accurately capture entries from the scanned image as per 
indicative metadata fields defined in Annexure V for each of driving license or motor 

vehicle record. 

 

 Meta data entry module may have facility for offline data entry and syncing with central 
server as the connectivity is available.

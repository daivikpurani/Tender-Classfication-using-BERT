functional device is used.
This can be conducted by
filling water at the bottom of
the device, hanging the ball
above the water, and then
sealing and keeping the
device at the room
temperature for 14 days. By
taking out the soft shell of
the fire extinguishing ball,
the chemical powder can be
examined. It must not
agglomerate.

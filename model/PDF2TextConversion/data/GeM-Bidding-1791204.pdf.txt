locations where they are held at that point of time to confirm that the stocks supplied by the supplier are
meeting the concerned DFS. Prior to drawl of such samples, the supplier will be intimated by the fastest means

unilaterally and the decision on the same will be final and no representation in this regard will be accepted later.

the time, date and place, as mentioned in clause 1.2.1 of this Document. 

4 The Bidders' names, modifications, bid withdrawals and the presence or

as the UIDAI, at its discretion, may consider appropriate will be announced at 

the bid opening. 

2.23 Clarification

2.25 Preliminary Examination 

1 The UIDAI will examine the bids to determine whether they are complete, 

whether any computational errors have been made, whether required 

EMD/Bid Securing Declaration has been furnished, whether the documents 

have been properly signed, and whether the bids are generally in order. 

2 Arithmetical errors will be rectified on the following basis.  

If there is a discrepancy between the unit cost and the total cost that is 

obtained by multiplying the unit cost and quantity, the unit cost shall prevail 

and the total cost shall be corrected. If the Bidder does not accept the 

correction of the errors, its bid will be rejected. If there is discrepancy between 

words and figures, the amount in words will prevail. 

3 A bid determined as not substantially responsive will be rejected by the UIDAI 

and may not subsequently be made responsive by the Bidder by correction of 

the nonconformity. 

4 The UIDAI may waive any minor infirmity or minor nonconformity or minor 

irregularity in a bid which does not constitute a material deviation, provided 

such waiver does not prejudice or affect the relative ranking of any Bidder. 

Decision of evaluation committee shall be final and binding on bidders on such 

issues. 

5 In case of submission of conditional bid or submitting conditions in bid which are not 

in conformity to the bid conditions, such bids are liable for rejection. However,  if such 

bid(s)  has/have  not been rejected or  no clarification or query or confirmation of 

acceptance of conditions has been explicitly sought/rendered by UIDAI, such case(s) 

would mean that no cognizance of the condition(s) set forth by bidder in the bid 

has/have been taken by UIDAI/purchaser and these conditions have been rejected by 

UIDAI/purchaser. If bidder happens to be successfully lowest no cognizance of these 

conditions shall be taken by UIDAI/Purchaser and bidder shall not have any right to 

press for inclusion of these conditions in the contract/LOI/NoA.  

2.26 Criteria for Evaluation of Bids 

1 To meet the UIDAI‟s requirements, as spelt out in the Bid Document, the 

successful bidder/Vendor must have the requisite experience in supply, 

installation, commissioning and maintenance of Hardware, the technical 

know-how, and the financial wherewithal that would be required to 

successfully set-up the required infrastructure and provide the Goods/Services 



T-11014/23/2017-Tech/Vol-I 

Page 34 of 151 
 

sought by the UIDAI, for the entire period of the contract. The evaluation 

process of the Bid proposed to be adopted by the UIDAI is indicated below so 

as to provide the Bidders an idea of the evaluation process that the UIDAI may 

adopt. Any time during the process of evaluation the UIDAI may seek specific 

clarifications from any or all Bidders. 

 

2 Phase I: Evaluation of Pre-Qualification and Technical Bids 

Technical Bids will be opened in the presence of representatives of the Bidders 

(not more than two representatives per bidder) who choose to be present as per 

the date and time indicated by the UIDAI. Evaluation of Technical bid is 

subject to meeting all pre qualification criteria. A detailed evaluation will be 

subsequently carried out by the UIDAI. In this phase, the Technical Bids will be 

reviewed for compliance of the Bid requirements with reference to the 

responses to the technical requirements given in Section IV and schedule of 

requirements of this Bid Document (Section V).Technical Bids which meet the 

above mentioned criteria will be eligible for consideration in the subsequent 

rounds. If required, the UIDAI may seek specific clarifications from any or all 

Bidder(s) at this stage. The UIDAI shall determine the Bidders that qualify for 

the next phase after reviewing the clarifications provided by the Bidder(s).  

 

3 Phase II: Evaluation of Commercial Bids 

In this phase, the Commercial Bids of the Bidders, who are technically qualified 

in Phase I, shall be opened. The Commercial Bid should contain the total price, 

both COST OF EQUIPMENT and post warranty AMC (OPEX) of all Goods/ 

Services, comprising of all equipment as mentioned in Annexure 4.2.1 to 

Annexure 4.2.3 of Section IV, proposed to be charged by the Bidder. Bidder to 

make sure that quoted cost of AMC is as per clause 2.8(5). If quoted cost of 

AMC is not as per clause 2.8(5), bid will be summarily rejected, even after 

completion of entire bid process. 

 

4 UIDAI will award the Contract to the successful Bidder whose bid has been 

determined to be technically qualified and has been determined as the lowest 

evaluated bid based upon lowest Overall Net Present Value to be 

calculated as given in subsequent clause 2.26 (5), provided further that 



T-11014/23/2017-Tech/Vol-I 

Page 35 of 151 
 

the Bidder is determined to be qualified to perform the Contract satisfactorily. 

The UIDAI will however not bind itself to accept the lowest evaluated bid or 

any bid and reserves the right to accept or reject any bid.  

 

5 The Overall Net Present Value (NPV) of each technically qualified bidder will 

be calculated based on the method and formula given in the table below : 

Components Quoted Price by Bidder NPV 

Value of the „COST OF 

EQUIPMENT‟ (Capex 

Cost) 

Total Cost at Annexure 4.2.2 

without taxes 

(say Z) 

Z 

Value of „COST OF 

AMC‟ (Opex Cost) 

Total Cost at Annexure 4.2.3 

without taxes 

(say Y) 

Yn = Y/(1+i)3 

Overall Net Present Value (NPV)                                           = (Z + Yn) 

 

(Where i=0.0875) (Overall NPV evaluation is only for the purpose of evaluation of 

lowest bid) 

 

6 In case any equipment included in Annexure 4.2.2 and 4.2.3 is not quoted by 

the Bidder, the bid would be rejected as non-responsive. Total contract value 

shall be as per annexure 4.2.1.  

 

7 UIDAI reserves the right to ask the bidder to validate any technical parameter 

in a laboratory environment at the time of evaluation of the Technical bid, at 

the cost of the bidder. 

 

2.27 Post Qualification 

1 The UIDAI will determine to its satisfaction whether successful bidder is 

qualified to satisfactorily perform the Contract. 

2 This determination will take into account the Bidder's financial, technical, 

implementation and post-implementation capabilities. It will be based upon an 

examination of the documentary evidence submitted by the Bidder as per document 

sought in the bid document as well as such other information as the UIDAI deems 

necessary and appropriate.

3.10 Warranty/AMC and Period Of Contract 

3.10.1 Warranty/AMC 

1. The Vendor warrants that the Goods supplied under the Contract are new, 

unused, of the most recent or current models and incorporate all recent 

improvements in design and materials unless provided otherwise in the 

Contract. The Vendor further warrants that the Goods supplied under this 

Contract shall have no defect arising from design, materials or 

workmanship (except insofar as the design or material is required by the 

Purchaser's Specifications) or from any act or omission of the Vendor, that 

may develop under normal use of the supplied Goods in the conditions 

prevailing in the country of final destination. 

2. This warranty shall remain valid, for 3 Years (36 months) in respect of 

equipment, or any portion thereof as the case may be, which have been 

delivered (and commissioned) to the final destination indicated and 

accepted as part of the scope of this bid. The warranty period shall 

commence from the date of acceptance of system i.e. UAT of all the devices 

by UIDAI after the   successful installation and commissioning of the same 

or 30 days after submission of ATRR by the bidder, whichever is earlier. In 

case if the warranty commences without UAT, then also, UAT is to be 

carried out during the currency of warranty at the earliest date. In case if 

UAT commences within 30 days of ATRR but is not successful due to 

default by vendor, in that case, warranty shall be shifted for the duration 

during which default persisted. Please refer clause 5.4.3 (4).  

Note: 

This clause supersedes all other clauses of RFP in case of any contradiction, 

provided the compliance of SLA provisions (as mentioned in RFP) during 

the testing period shall remain unaffected by this modification. 

For e.g.

3.11.2 AMC 

 

Post warranty, total annual maintenance charges of that year would be paid in 4 

Nos of equal quarterly instalments after completion of each quarter of the AMC 

period. For calculation of yearly AMC charges, 10% increment over the previous 

year AMC charges will be considered.   

 

Thus yearly AMC charges will be calculated from Total AMC changes as below: 

   Y= Y4 + Y5 + Y6+ Y7 

   Y= x + (x*1.1) + (x*1.12)+ (x* 1.13 ) 

i.e Y= x*4.641  

Where 

Y= Total Cost as per Annexure 4.2.3 

Y4=x= Fourth year AMC Charges = Y/4.641 

Y5 = Fifth year AMC Charges = x*1.1 = Y*1.1/4.641 

Y6 = Sixth year AMC Charges = x*1.12 = Y*1.21/4.641 

Y7 = Seventh year AMC Charges = x*1.13 = Y*1.331/4.641 

Example : 

If Rs 4,641 is quotes as total AMC charges for total 4 years, then the yearly AMC 

charges will be considered as below 

AMC cost for 4th year = x = 4641/4.641 = Rs 1,000/- 

AMC cost for 5th year = x*1.1 = 4641*1.1/4.641 = Rs 1,100/- 

AMC cost for 6th year = x*1.12 = 4641*1.21/4.641 = Rs 1,210/- 

AMC cost for 7th year = x*1.13 = 4641*1.331/4.641 = Rs 1,331/- 



T-11014/23/2017-Tech/Vol-I 

Page 51 of 151 
 

The quarterly payment will be (Yearly charges of that year)/4

In consideration of disclosure of confidential information, and in order to ensure the Authority’s 

grant to the Bidder of specific access to Authority’s confidential information, property,

Page 100 of 151 
 

information systems, network, databases and other data, the Bidder agrees to all of the following 

conditions. 

It is hereby agreed as under: 

1 The confidential information to be disclosed by the Authority shall include without 

limitation, any and all information in written, representational, electronic, verbal or other

to be present on premises of the Authority or may require the Bidder’s personnel to have 

access to software, hardware, computer networks, databases, documents and storage media of 

the Authority while on or off premises of the Authority. It is understood that it would be

of all such information. Therefore, the Bidder undertakes that it shall be liable for any and all 

unauthorized access to and disclosure of Confidential Information by any of its employees,

CIRCULAR – 2 
 
It has been directed by our CO that no new labour contract be entrusted to any agency without getting 
prior approval from the Managing Director /Executive Director  the existing contacts, on their expiry, 
may not be extended without approval of the Member (A) HO, Baroda. 
 
In light of the instructions conveyed by HO, it is necessary to check up the following documents of each 
and every contractor before awarding the contract to these contactors. For preliminary checking of 
valid contractors, the following documents are required to be checked by the concerned DE/EE/SE. On 
their checking the same and by recommending number of labourers, gate pass will be issued by the 
Factory manager. But before awarding and finalizing any contract, following information must reach to 
IRO for his confirmation the contracts should be awarded. 
 
1 The contractor should not be allowed to engage ten or more contract labourers without  

initiating to obtain the labour license under the Contract Labour Act from the Assistant 
Commissioner of Labour Surat (the said number i.e., ten or more includes Supervisor and other 
staff.).      
 

2 Number of days of the contract should be informed first before allowing the contractor to start, 
because on completion of sixty days, the contract labour becomes liable for CPF as per 
provident Fund Act.1952. Hence, we should avoid such work as far as possible. The 
contractors also must go for group insurance under WC Act before starting the work. 

 
3 Payment to contract laborers has to be made in presence of IRO/LWO. Wages rates for 

contract laborers are applicable as per the terms and conditions of the license. The contractor 
shall have to pay wages to workers as notified by Government of Gujarat., from time to time 

 The above instructions must be followed scrupulously to avoid labour liabilities under contact 
Labour.

A.) SCOPE OF SUPPLY  

1.0 The project is on turnkey basis and all items as required for completion of project shall be 
supplied by single bidder only. 

2.0 Supply of Energy meter, Approved Make: Secure/Schneider /Masibus/ Siemens / Conserve. 
The Supplied meters shall fully comply with basic specifications as attached in Annexure - B. 

3.0  Supply of Energy Monitoring Software as per requirements listed by GSECL  Ukai. 
4.0 Supply of  Server Grade PC, Client PC, Laptop - PC with lifetime valid license software &  

necessary operating system with antivirus and required related systems. The Server Machine, 
Client Machine and Laptop should comply with minimum Specification(s) as listed in technical 
specification of LAN. 

5.0 The single bidder has to supply whole energy management system & time synchronizes with 
existing GPS including cabling/wiring/creating multiple points from available point of GPS lying 
in plant. which Includes supply and retrofitting energy meters, energy management software, 
provision of CT(where not provided) High speed low loss data cable, Ethernet converter, 
connector kit, Meter networking cable, & its peripherals with software etc as required in whole 
project. Power supply cables for various instruments, data converters, data logger, control room 
equipment etc. is in the scope of bidder. Cabling accessories for the data cables like lugs, tying 
sleeves, cable trays (if necessary) etc. is also in scope of the bidder. 

6.0 The scope includes Supply of blanking plate for installing new Energy Meters, cables, wires, 
consumable items like lugs, connectors, screws, ferules nut bolts and all other accessories 
which are necessary for aesthetic view & satisfactory operation of complete EMS system 
though not individually or specifically mentioned herein. 

7.0 The Bidder should submit the bid considering minimum quantity as identified and mentioned in 
Annexure – A, However for the consumable items Viz, Supply of OFC cables, Power/Wiring 
cables, Cable laying etc shall be paid based on actual work executed and there-on verified by 
Authorized GSECL – official. 
Also, Note that all additional cost in line with supply of consumable items shall be borne by the 
customer. 
E.g. : If OFC Cable minimum quantity as per GTP = 15000 Meters. The bid should be 
submitted for 15000 meters of cable only. 
Case : 1 : If actual cable used = 13000, Payment as per 13000 meters only. 
Case : 2 : If actual cable used = 15500(Or More), Payment as per 15000 only. 

8.0 The bidder should visit the Power Station/Site to access the requirement, quantum of work, 
dimension detail & any other information/requirement of data to fulfill the job etc before 
submitting the bid. 

9.0 The CT’s should be supplied in full compliance to specifications as mentioned in technical 
specification of current transformer. The quantity (1 set = 3 Nos. of CT)  of CT’s to be supplied 
is clearly mentioned. 

10.0 Any other material which is not specified but necessary to supply to ensure completion of  the 
job shall be the responsibility of the bidders. 

 
 
B.) Technical Specifications of Energy Monitoring Software 
 
 
1. The basic need of EMS is to monitor and record energy data from all the metering nodes over 

TCP/IP. The software shall support 100% additional nodes for future additions & shall have facility 
to connect the future energy meters.

connecting breathing tube. The airflow creates a slight 
positive pressure which together with the sealing to the face 
prevents particles and other contaminants from entering the 
head top.

Definition and Clinical
Purpose

Definition Mains electricity (AC-
powered) mobile
device that contains an
infrared (IR) heating
element(s) designed to
emit controlled, evenly
distributed overhead
heat to the body of a
newborn/infant patient
requiring supplemental
heat. This device is
equipped with wheels
so that it can easily be
moved to different
areas of a room, ward,
or department.

*

Clinical purpose
&Overview of
functional
requirements

It is an electrically
powered device with a
radiant heating source
intended to maintain
the thermal balance of
an infant by direct
radiation of energy in
the infrared region of
the electromagnetic
spectrum. It is a
microprocessor
controlled unit with
heater placed on the
over head panel. This
work on both servo and
manual mode options
to maintain the baby
temperature at the set
value. There are two
modes of operation
manual and baby
(servo) mode. It has
Digital displays reading
the set and baby
observed temperatures
seperately.

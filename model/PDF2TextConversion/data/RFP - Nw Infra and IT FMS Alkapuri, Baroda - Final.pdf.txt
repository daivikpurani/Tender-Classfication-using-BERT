4. Evaluation process 

A two stage process is adopted for selection of the vendor: 

 Stage 1 – Eligibility Cum Technical Bid 

 Stage 2 – Commercial Bid 

During evaluation of the Tenders, the Bank, at its discretion, may ask the Vendor for 
clarification in respect of its tender. The request for clarification and the response shall 
be in writing, and no change in the substance of the tender shall be sought, offered, 
or permitted. The Bank reserves the right to accept or reject any tender in whole or in 
parts without assigning any reason thereof. The decision of the Bank shall be final and 
binding on all the vendors to this document and bank will not entertain any 
correspondence in this regard.  

4.1 Eligibility & Technical Bid 

Eligibility criterion for the Vendor to qualify this stage is clearly mentioned in Annexure 
02 – Eligibility Criterion Compliance to this document. The vendor would need to 
provide supporting documents as part of the eligibility proof.  

The technical bids of only those vendors who qualify in the eligibility criteria will be 
evaluated. The Technical Proposal will be evaluated for technical suitability (Annexure 
12 & Annexure 16A-16D).  

Vendors who meet these criteria would only qualify for the commercial bid opening. 

4.2 Commercial Bid Evaluation  

The commercial bids of only those vendors who qualify in both eligibility and technical 
evaluation will be opened. The date for opening of the commercial bid would be 
communicated separately to the eligible vendors. The commercial bid would be 
evaluated based on a “Total Cost of Ownership” (‘TCO’) basis. The key considerations 
of the TCO would be the total payouts for entire project through the contract period of 
5 years, discounted at 10% to arrive at the present value of the future cash outflows. 
The evaluation will be done as follows: 

 The discounted rate will be calculated on yearly basis based on the formula 
A/(1+i/100)n where A= Total Value in each Year; i=10% and n =Year. 

 The Present Value will be calculated for all components where the payment is 
recurring year on year. The Present Value for the component will start from the 
year of purchase of that component / start of the services (AMC) and shall be 
calculated till the end year of the contract. Further n - number of period will be ‘0’ 
in the year of purchase of that component / start of the services and subsequently 
increased by 1 for subsequent years.  

 Any component / service for which the payment is a One Time Cost the NPV cost 
of the equipment / service for that year will be considered and the relevant year’s 
NPV cost will be added as part of the Present Value calculation for that year. 
Further the payment of the OTC component / service not being recurring in nature
